            <p className="px-2 lg:px-10  text-lg">
              Here at Spellbrush, we're passionate about making a good anime game.

              We also happen to be the world's leading generative AI studio — we're the team behind niji・journey.
              We are currently investigating how AI can be used to help human artists perform masterpieces in the most complex medium of our times: videogames.

              Our games are characterized by a no-compromise approach to well-balanced gameplay married to a truthful love of visual arts.
              If you love turn-based tactics games, please consider applying!
