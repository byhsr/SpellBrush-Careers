              Here at Spellbrush, we're passionate about making a good anime game.

              We also happen to be the world's leading generative AI studio — we're the team behind niji・journey.
              We are currently investigating how AI can be used to help human artists perform masterpieces in the most complex medium of our times: videogames.

              Our games are characterized by a no-compromise approach to well-balanced gameplay married to a truthful love of visual arts.
              If you love turn-based tactics games, please consider applying!

            <h2 className="text-2xl ">The Frontend Role:</h2>
            <p className="px-10 text-sm]">We're seeking a talented Front-End Engineer to join our team and help us build the next generation of anime and video game tools. You'll be responsible for
              designing and developing complex front-end applications, usually in react and typescript, with a focus on making responsive and delightful user interfaces.</p>
          </div>

                <h6 className="">You love anime and the anime aesthetic</h6>
                <p className="">As a member of our team, you'll have the opportunity to push the boundaries of what's possible in the anime and video game industry. Ideally you're a fan of the genre.         </p>

              <div className="space-y-1">


                <h6 className="">You enjoy working on complex SPAs.</h6>
                <p className=""> Most of our apps are interaction-heavy single-page editors, much closer in spirit to photoshop and blender than your typical SaaS app. A willingness to dive headfirst into canvas, webGL, and (maybe!) webGPU is recommended!</p>

                <h6>you also have some design sense.</h6>
                <p className="">Large complex SPAs have all sorts of super interesting UI/UX challenges! We're looking for someone with experience building tasteful UI, a good design sense for layout, experiences, and microinteractions.

                <p className="">
                  We currently have a tiny team of three on frontend engineering. You'll be working directly with some of the best AI researchers in the world to integrate their state-of-the-art models into your beautiful interfaces.

                  We also believe in the unmatched speed of in-person teams, and prefer on-site collaboration in either our primary research office in Tokyo (downtown Akihabara) or San Francisco. Visa sponsorships are available.</p>
